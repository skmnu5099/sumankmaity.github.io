I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) and MIT Center for Research on Equitable and Open Scholarship (CREOS) hosted by {{< staticref "http://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/" >}}Prof. Roger Levy{{< /staticref >}}. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at Center for Science of Science and Innovation (CSSI) and The Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems 
(NICO), Northwestern University working with {{< staticref "https://www.dashunwang.com/" >}}Prof. Dashun Wang{{< /staticref >}}. I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where I was advised by  {{< staticref "https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/" >}}Prof. Animesh Mukherjee{{< /staticref >}}. I was also the recipient of IBM PhD Fellowship and Microsoft Research India PhD Fellowship Award.

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary area of Social Data Science, where I investigate the mechanisms and dynamics of complex social systems. My research on social media focuses on understanding how various sociolinguistic phenomena emerge, are adopted; used and misused. I have contributed in understanding the detection of hate content, misinformation and adoption of mitigation strategies to stop spread of negativity on social media platforms. 

I am also interested in the broad areas of Science of Science where I study the global landscape of scientific research funding, publications and their interplay; risk taking behavior, the impact of success or failure on professional career, and various aspects of Open Science Communication â€“ Citation bias and inclusivity, Open Peer Review etc.
