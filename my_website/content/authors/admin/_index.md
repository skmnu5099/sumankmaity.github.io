I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) and MIT Center for Research on Equitable and Open Scholarship (CREOS) hosted by {{< staticref "http://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/" >}}Prof. Roger Levy{{< /staticref >}}. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at Center for Science of Science and Innovation (CSSI) and The Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems 
(NICO), Northwestern University working with {{< staticref "https://www.dashunwang.com/" >}}Prof. Dashun Wang{{< /staticref >}}. I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where I was advised by  {{< staticref "https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/" >}}Prof. Animesh Mukherjee{{< /staticref >}}. I was also the recipient of IBM PhD Fellowship and Microsoft Research India PhD Fellowship Award.

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary area of Human-centered Data Science where I study the mechanisms and dynamics of various complex systems. In particular, my major research focus is on studying the impact of success and failure on professional careers; the global landscape of science fundings, publications, and their interplay; and several aspects of Open Science. I also aim to design tools to better understand social phenomena which are aggravated by the misuse of social media platforms (e.g., detection and mitigation of hate speech and incivility).
